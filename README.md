# create-tsdev

> Using npx to generate a TS dev env.

## Installation

```sh
$ npx create-tsdev
```

Please note you need to init your project before you can use this tool

## Options

By default it will init the TS dev env inside your project root. Or you can pass `--to /where/your/project/root`. So it will switch over to that folder.
